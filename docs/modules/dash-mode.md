# Module: dash-mode

## Purpose

Single source of truth for the current dashboard operating mode. Persists the mode
to the config DB so it survives a process restart. Emits a `'change'` event on
every transition so all subsystems react without polling.

## Responsibilities

- Expose the current mode as `dashMode.value` (reads DB on every call)
- Persist mode changes via `setConfig`
- Emit `'change'` with the new mode on every `set()` call

## Dependencies

- `db.js` — `getConfig`, `setConfig`
- `node:events` — EventEmitter base

## Public interface

```js
export const dashMode  // singleton instance of DashMode

dashMode.value         // getter → number — current mode (reads DB each call)
dashMode.set(mode)     // → void — persist mode and emit 'change'
dashMode.on('change', ({ _mode }) => {})  // EventEmitter listener
```

### Mode values

| Value | Name | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| `0` | PASV | Passive monitoring. `passiveTracer` auto-traces nodes heard via radio. |
| `1` | ACTV | Active tracking. `activeTracker` runs the ACTV scan cycle. |
| `2` | SCAN | BLE scan. `scanner` drives the antenna rotation sweep. |

## State

No in-memory state. Mode is read directly from the config DB on every `value` access.

## Events emitted

| Event | Payload | When |
|---|---|---|
| `'change'` | `{ _mode: number }` | Every `set()` call, even if mode is unchanged |

## Invariants

- `dashMode.value` always reflects the DB value. There is no in-memory cache — a change written by any path is immediately visible to the next `value` read.
- `'change'` fires on every `set()` call. Callers must not assume it fires only on actual transitions — idempotent handlers required.
- Config key is `'rotator.dash_mode'` with default `0` (PASV). This key is owned by this module; no other module writes it.
- Mode is stored as an integer in the config table (JSON-serialised by `setConfig`).

## Test notes

- `dashMode.value` returns `0` when config key absent (default)
- `dashMode.set(1)` → `dashMode.value === 1`; `'change'` fires with `{ _mode: 1 }`
- `dashMode.set(0)` after `set(1)` → `'change'` fires again (even though reverting)
- Listener added via `.on('change', fn)` receives every transition

## Out of scope

- Mode transition side-effects — callers own those (index.js starts/stops activeTracker, scanner, passiveTracer on `'change'`)
- Validating mode values — callers are responsible for passing valid integers
- Broadcasting mode to browser — ws-relay.js listens to `'change'` and sends `rotator` WebSocket messages
